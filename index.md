            I am a senior statistician on the carbon team at <a href = "http://www.indigoag.com"> Indigo Ag </a>. Prior to joining Indigo, I worked at <a href = "http://www.flatiron.com"> Flatiron Health </a> and completed a PhD in <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/"> Biostatistics at the University of Michigan</a>, advised by <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/elliott-michael.html"> Michael Elliott</a>, <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/braun-thomas.html"> Tom Braun</a>, and <a href = "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jianghui/"> Hui Jiang</a>.<br>

            At Indigo, I work with an interdisciplinary team to quantify the climate benefits of regenerative farming practices. We pay growers through carbon credits for sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In previous roles, I have focused on using electronic health records to complement clinical trials in oncology and to conduct observational studies. I have also developed statistical methods for genetics and psychology, collaborated on social science research, and worked on environmental policies and programs.
