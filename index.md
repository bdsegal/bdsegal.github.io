            I am a quantitative scientist at <a href = "http://www.flatiron.com"> Flatiron Health</a>. Prior to joining Flatiron, I completed a PhD in <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/"> Biostatistics at the University of Michigan</a>, advised by <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/elliott-michael.html"> Michael Elliott</a>, <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/braun-thomas.html"> Tom Braun</a>, and <a href = "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jianghui/"> Hui Jiang</a>.<br>
            <br>
            At Flatiron, I am currently focused on using data from electronic health records to complement and enhance clinical trials in oncology. In my past roles, I have developed statistical methods for genetics and psychology, collaborated on social science research, and worked on government-industry partnerships and regulatory efforts in the environmental field.
