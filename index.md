            I am a Quantitative Scientist at <a href = "http://www.flatiron.com"> Flatiron Health</a>, where I design and analyze studies to assess the quality of data abstracted from electronic health records. Prior to joining Flatiron, I completed a PhD in <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/"> Biostatistics at the University of Michigan</a>, advised by <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/elliott-michael.html"> Michael Elliott</a>, <a href = "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/braun-thomas.html"> Tom Braun</a>, and <a href = "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jianghui/"> Hui Jiang</a>.<br>
            <br>
            My research interests include resampling methods, semi-parametric regression, and alternatives to hypothesis testing that emphasize estimation. I am also interested in applications in a variety of fields, including medicine, the life sciences, and psychology.
