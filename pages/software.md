## R packages

[fastPerm](https://github.com/bdsegal/fastPerm): Quickly approximates small permutation p-values for the difference and ratio of means.

[gammaDist](https://github.com/bdsegal/gammaDist): Computes the distribution and density of the difference of two gamma random variables under the null of equal distributions. Includes a saddlepoint approximation to the density.

**In development**

[matrixTest](https://github.com/bdsegal/matrixTest): Tests symmetric matrices for block-diagonal structure under the null of exchangeable off-diagonal elements. Based on a permutation test with Hubert's Gamma and a t-statistic.

[psplinesl1](https://github.com/bdsegal/psplinesl1): Fits additive mixed models with P-splines and an l1 penalty using alternating direction method of multipliers and cross validation.
